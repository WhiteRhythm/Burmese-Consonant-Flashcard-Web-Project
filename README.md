# Burmese-Consonant-Flashcard-Web-Project
## OOP group assignment project
Welcome to the Burmese-Consonant-Flashcard-Web-Project wiki!

This project is a simple, interactive learning tool designed to help students practice and memorize Burmese consonants in an easy and enjoyable way. It combines clean UI design, basic authentication, and a responsive flashcard system to create a smooth learning experience for both logged-in students and visitors who just want to practice quickly.

The application begins with a warm, inviting homepage where users can either sign in as a student or jump straight into practice mode without creating an account. For learners who log in, the system provides a more personalized entry into the study environment. Guests, on the other hand, can instantly start flipping through consonant flashcards, perfect for quick revision or casual learning.

At the heart of the project is the flashcard interface, which shows a random Burmese consonant and allows users to flip the card to reveal its sound, shape, and meaning in English. We also added more detailed info about the consonant on the right, which you can see it shows how to pronounce the sound, which group it's in, and what position within the Burmese alphabet it is at. Each new click brings another character, helping learners build familiarity through repetition and recognition. We also added a collection set on the left side to see what your progress is at and how many consonants you have discovered from each new card you click. The animations and visuals are designed to reflect the elegance of the Burmese script, making the studying experience both educational and aesthetically pleasing.

Behind the scenes, the project uses a simple Java-based backend to generate random consonant flashcards and handle login requests. The frontend is written in HTML, and Java to keep everything lightweight and fast. Together, they create a small but effective web app that demonstrates both object-oriented programming principles and practical frontend–backend integration.

Whether you're a student learning Burmese or just exploring the language, this project offers a clean, minimal, and user-friendly tool for practicing the foundations of the Burmese alphabet.
